# Project 2 - *Flix*

**Flix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I am interested in seeing if there is any way to reduce the amount of copying and pasting that I do with the code. For example, the table view and collection view were implemented in separate files but many of their shared features where just copied and pasted which seems inefficient.
2. I would like to see how to add to the design so that users can see what movies are more popular with some stats rather than just by date.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges encountered included making sure that everything was linked together and identified correctly as well as building an intuition of what to do at each step, because the language and environment is still relatively new.
